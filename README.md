# CI Yelp

This is Collective Intelligence Yelp. This is the distribution code for the group assignment of the [Collective Intelligentie course](https://ci.mprog.nl) at the University of Amsterdam.

# The data

Some example data is contained in the folder `data`.

To keep the repository lean, this contains the data of only two cities: Sun City and Westlake.

You can download the full dataset here: [full data (4.5 GB)](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/d9QtNlGNbYuUnpT/download)

As a point of advice: don't use the entire dataset for you recommender system and don't commit the full dataset to your repository. Decide which part of the data you want to work on, and only commit that to the collective repository.

# Loading the data

The notebook `project.ipynb` contains some example code to help you on your way.
